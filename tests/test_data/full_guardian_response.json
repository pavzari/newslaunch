Diogo Santos Coelho, who has been assessed as at very high risk of suicide, said he had been groomed and exploited online by adults from the age of 14 into committing the alleged crimes, which relate to the website RaidForums.

Hester’s main operating company, the Phoenix Partnership (Leeds), recorded a turnover of £80m with profit before tax of £40m in the year to March 2023,<strong> </strong>Companies House documents show.</p> <p>It paid a salary of £510,000 to Hester, its sole director. Over a period of five years from 2019 to 2023, the ultimate parent company, TPP Group, paid out £33.5m in dividends, which appear to have gone to Hester as its only shareholder.</p> <p>As sole director and shareholder of TPP, Hester does not have a board or other shareholders to report to.</p>    <p>In public life, Hester has had a relatively low profile for someone who runs a business of such critical importance. He said in an <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/02/29/biggest-tory-donor-frank-hester-5m/\">interview with the Telegraph</a> this month that he spent much of his life voting for the Green party or spoiling his ballot, but under the current Conservative government he has been part of trade missions led by senior Tory figures.</p> <p>He was made an OBE in 2015 for services to healthcare, and joined David Cameron and Ken Clarke on trade trips. He met Boris Johnson at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in South Africa in 2020.</p> <p>TPP has in an official capacity met government figures three times since July 2021, including Steve Barclay, the former health secretary, according to government filings.</p> <p>Hester has spoken in favour of AI – the company says it is developing an AI model designed to predict the likelihood of patients failing to attend appointments – and he has also publicly lobbied the NHS to stop spending money on expensive IT systems, writing an open letter saying: “We are here for our NHS. We are here to help. Not to drive profits for shareholders, or to grease revolving doors. Let’s do it for the frontline and choose to digitise in an entirely different way.”</p> <p>Last year, Hester made a surprise £5m gift to the Conservatives, putting him in the limelight. He set out his motivations at the time, saying he was donating to Rishi Sunak’s party because he believed it could deliver for the NHS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&amp;description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.me%2F%23p%2F%2B447824537227%22%3ESignal%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Contact the team securely: create a Protonmail account and email us at guardian.politics.desk@protonmail.com; or use Signal Messenger or WhatsApp to message +44 7824 537227.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.me%2F%23p%2F%2B447824537227%22%3ESignal%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&link=false\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“As a businessman from Yorkshire I have been fortunate enough to have met the prime minister.

By Hester’s own estimation, the Phoenix Partnership (TPP) – the software company he built from scratch and solely owns – is worth £1bn after winning more than £400m of NHS and prison contracts in the last eight years. To celebrate reaching this milestone in 2019, he threw a “unicorn party” at his mansion near Leeds, complete with horses dressed up with horns, and his staff were invited to celebrate. A computer programmer from West Yorkshire’s biggest city, Hester is included on the Sunday Times rich list with an estimated wealth of £415m. Former employees tell of big perks and a partying lifestyle for staff, driven by Hester. He would provide a free bar at the local pub on Fridays, and staff would be invited to week-long sailing trips, paid for by the company. A larger-than-life personality, Hester would often socialise with staff and participate in company-wide WhatsApp groups and meetings, on occasion casually throwing around bad language. Former staff describe him as a formidable and blunt presence in the office, with some saying they were at pains to address him in the right way on the phone and pick up to him within two rings, as well as following the firm’s “no bullshitting” ethos in their interactions with him at the time. The businessman got the idea for TPP along with a university friend and set about building the software for the company in about 2005. He has previously described being frustrated seeing his now ex-wife, a GP, struggling with patient software and wanting to create a better product. His software, SystmOne, was born, and gradually throughout the 2000s and 2010s it became one of the two incumbent players in the market, supplying about 2,700 GP surgeries in England with a way of accessing digital medical records on their computers. The medical records are held on a server at an unknown location, with TPP storing them securely and making them available across the NHS, according to its website. It has been a highly profitable service. Hester’s main operating company, the Phoenix Partnership (Leeds), recorded a turnover of £80m with profit before tax of £40m in the year to March 2023, Companies House documents show. It paid a salary of £510,000 to Hester, its sole director. Over a period of five years from 2019 to 2023, the ultimate parent company, TPP Group, paid out £33.5m in dividends, which appear to have gone to Hester as its only shareholder. As sole director and shareholder of TPP, Hester does not have a board or other shareholders to report to. In public life, Hester has had a relatively low profile for someone who runs a business of such critical importance. He said in an interview with the Telegraph this month that he spent much of his life voting for the Green party or spoiling his ballot, but under the current Conservative government he has been part of trade missions led by senior Tory figures. He was made an OBE in 2015 for services to healthcare, and joined David Cameron and Ken Clarke on trade trips. He met Boris Johnson at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in South Africa in 2020. TPP has in an official capacity met government figures three times since July 2021, including Steve Barclay, the former health secretary, according to government filings. Hester has spoken in favour of AI – the company says it is developing an AI model designed to predict the likelihood of patients failing to attend appointments – and he has also publicly lobbied the NHS to stop spending money on expensive IT systems, writing an open letter saying: “We are here for our NHS. We are here to help. Not to drive profits for shareholders, or to grease revolving doors. Let’s do it for the frontline and choose to digitise in an entirely different way.” Last year, Hester made a surprise £5m gift to the Conservatives, putting him in the limelight. He set out his motivations at the time, saying he was donating to Rishi Sunak’s party because he believed it could deliver for the NHS. “As a businessman from Yorkshire I have been fortunate enough to have met the prime minister. He shares my passion for harnessing the data revolution to transform the way we as citizens access healthcare,” he wrote. To accompany the announcement this month of the second £5m donation, from his company, Hester rejected the idea that he was giving money in order to secure more government contracts, saying many came from hospitals and GPs. “GPs decide which software they’re using, not Rishi Sunak,” he said.",

          "bodyText": "As a Fulton county, Georgia, board of registration and elections meeting began in earnest on Thursday afternoon, the elections director, Nadine Williams, unfurled a prepared statement about a recent hack of county government computers. “There is no indication that this event is related to the election process,” Williams said. “In an abundance of caution, Fulton county and the secretary of state’s respective technology systems were isolated from one another as part of the response efforts. We are working with our team to securely reconnect these systems as preparations for upcoming elections continue.” Any time the Fulton county elections board meets, a cantankerous crowd greets them to pepper appointees with challenges to voter registrations or demands for paper ballots or generally unsympathetic noise. The rancor of the 2020 election and its unfounded charges of vote tampering still ripple through the democratic process. Elections officials in Fulton county take care about what they say, knowing that a platoon of critics lie waiting to pounce on a misplaced word. Even by that standard, county officials have been holding uncharacteristically tightly to a prepared script – or saying nothing at all – in the days since a computer breach debilitated everything from the tax and water billing department to court records to phones. “Because it’s under investigation, they’re telling me to stick to a list of talking points,” said the Fulton county commissioner Bridget Thorne. “The county attorney drafted them.” She did say that the county had come under a ransomware attack – and that the county had not paid off the attacker. “We’re insured very well,” she said. Systems began to fail on the weekend of 27 January. Ten days later, the phones for most departments returned a busy signal error when callers rang them up. County officials either cannot or will not directly and completely answer important questions about the cyber-attack’s scope. The Fulton county chair Robb Pitts made a brief statement on 29 January about the hack without taking questions. “At this time, we are not aware of any transfer of sensitive information about citizens or employees, but we will continue to look carefully at this issue,” Pitts said. “We want the public to be aware that we will keep them informed as additional information become available.” County commissioners held an emergency meeting with only two hours’ notice on Thursday evening, ostensibly to discuss the cyber-attack. The commission immediately entered a closed executive session, emerging 90 minutes later to say nothing to reporters. Asked whether leaders were aware whether sensitive personal information had been stolen by hackers, the county spokesperson refused to say. The FBI is leading the investigation, with assistance from the Georgia bureau of investigation and Homeland Security’s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency (CISA). An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had been in contact with Fulton county regarding the hack but could not comment on an active investigation. If this were any other county, common concerns about whether residents’ or employees’ credit card data had been stolen and when water billing would resume would be at the forefront of conversations. But Fulton county is where political freight trains cross tracks. Fulton county, home to most of Atlanta, is the largest county in one of the US’s most contested swing states. It is the subject of continuing litigation over the security of its election equipment in federal court. Last year, Georgia replaced its creaky voter-registration system with the Georgia registered voter information system, or Garvis. The state built the system on a Salesforce base. Garvis complies with the FedRamp federal standard for cloud-computing security, according to the office’s statements. A computer system that is FedRamp-compliant has monitoring safeguards to see whether unusual amounts of data are flowing out of storage servers – a telltale sign that hackers are stealing personally identifiable information. When the elections division of the Georgia secretary of state’s office heard that Fulton county’s computers had been hacked, it first cut the county off from access to the state’s computers – and then shut everyone out of Garvis just to make sure the central system had been unaffected, said Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for the state office. The state restored registration services to other counties within a day or two, after checking the logs to ensure nothing strange had taken place. State elections officials asked the county to wipe their elections computers back to the baseline, which they have done, Hassinger said. Those computers are isolated from the rest of the network, he said. “We are now back up and running on Garvis,” Williams, the Fulton county elections director, said on Thursday. Fulton county, like every other county, is preparing for the next election: the presidential preference primary on 12 March. Registration for that contest ends next week. There are no slow weeks in Atlanta. Fulton county is also where the former president Donald Trump faces criminal charges for attempting to tamper with the 2020 election. And the court’s creaky computer system is all the way down. For example, this morning, after the high-profile arrest of an activist on Thursday on arson charges related to “Cop City” protests, the media engaged in a spirited argument with court and jail staff. Arraignments are usually done by Zoom meeting with a prisoner remaining at the jail. But Zoom is offline. A judge was forced to trundle into Fulton county’s notorious jail to conduct the proceeding in person, yet the jail doesn’t allow visitors. Eventually, the sheriff relented and allowed some media representatives inside. The hack didn’t target the district attorney’s office and will not affect the Trump case, said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesperson for the office. “All material related to the election case is kept in a separate, highly secure system that was not hacked and is designed to make any unauthorized access extremely difficult, if not impossible,” he said. The office has yet to respond to questions about whether evidence stored on county computers in other criminal cases might have been compromised. Notably, the Atlanta police department said it isn’t accepting emails from Fulton county email addresses for the moment, just in case. The county’s court, tax and financial systems have been particularly affected, said the county manager, Richard “Dick” Anderson. “Our teams have been working around the clock to understand the nature and scope of the incident,” Anderson said in a briefing before the county commission on 7 February. “While a number of our key systems have been affected by this outage, it’s important to note that we have no reason to believe that this incident is related to the election process or any other current events.” Fulton county employs about 5,000 people.

          "bodyText": "Microsoft says it will invest an additional $5bn in Australia over the next two years to expand hyperscale cloud computing capacity while collaborating with the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) to boost domestic protection from cyber threats. Anthony Albanese confirmed the new investment on the opening day of his state visit to the United States during an event at the Australian embassy in Washington, flanked by Microsoft’s vice-chair and president, Brad Smith, and Microsoft Australia and New Zealand Managing director Steven Worrall. The announcement in Washington comes ahead of the Albanese government articulating a new Australian cybersecurity strategy covering the period to 2030. Release of the new Australian strategy is expected within weeks. After starting his day in the US capital with a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider at Arlington National Cemetery and a visit to the gravesites of two Australians buried there, Albanese confirmed Microsoft’s plans at an event during the afternoon. Microsoft says the collaboration with the Australian government to boost domestic cybersecurity will enhance “joint capability to identify, prevent and respond to cyber threats, which are growing in both frequency and severity”. In a statement, the computing giant said the exchange of cyber threat information leads to better protection for Australian residents, businesses and government entities. Microsoft said the focus of its activity would be on detecting, analysing and defending against sophisticated nation-state cyber threats. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The director general of ASD, Rachel Noble, said the investments would strengthen the agency’s “strong partnership with Microsoft and … turbocharge our collective capacity to protect Australians in cyberspace”. A recent threat report from the Australian Cyber Security Centre found one incident is reported on average in Australia every seven minutes. More than 76,000 incidents of cybercrime were reported in 2021-22. Albanese said he welcomed Microsoft’s collaboration with ASD because a strong economy required protection from cyber threats. The prime minister also characterised Microsoft’s commitments as “a major investment in the skills and workers of the future, which will help Australia to strengthen our position as a world-leading economy”. Microsoft says the new investment in Australia will increase its computing capacity by around 250% over the next two years, enabling the company to meet growing demand for cloud computing services. It would also help Australia capitalise on “the significant economic and productivity opportunities presented by the latest AI technology”. The computing giant has committed to supporting an additional 300,000 Australians as part of its global skills programs and is “working towards” launching its first Datacentre Academy in Australia in early 2024, in partnership with Tafe NSW. The computing giant says the enhanced funding is the single largest investment in Australia during its 40-year presence in the country. Worrall said in a statement the proposed infrastructure, skilling and cybersecurity investments and initiatives would “build on our long-term commitment to Australia, but are squarely focused on the future”. “They will not only enable a safer and more secure digital economy, but also provide a platform to foster growth and innovation in the era of AI,” Worrall said.",

The national security law watchdog is currently investigating the operation and effectiveness of the National Security Information Act 2004 (NSI Act), which the federal government uses to protect sensitive information during court proceedings. The use of the NSI Act has prompted concern in several cases in recent years, including in the Collaery case, where significant parts of his since-abandoned trial would have been hidden from the public. In an extraordinary submission to the inquiry, Collaery’s legal team has detailed the “profound” cost and disadvantage his legal team faced as a result of the secrecy restrictions. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Collaery was forced to obtain government approval before his chosen barrister, Bret Walker SC, could view material against his client ahead of a crucial appeal. The government sat on the request for approval for four weeks, leaving Walker unable to access “any of the large amount of confidential material in the case to provide advice” until just before the hearing, conduct the judge described as “disturbing”. Collaery’s team, spread across three cities, faced huge barriers in communicating about the case, obtaining instructions and sharing material. Some documents could only be discussed in person, in rooms that were government-approved. To share documents between members of the legal team, they either had to send physical copies carried by an approved lawyer between cities, or pay about $1,000 a trip for an approved courier. The documents had to be double-bagged within approved locked containers. Some confidential documents had to be stored in locked safes and only handled in locations pre-approved by the government, and only in the absence of phones and other electronic devices, other than commonwealth equipment. Documents containing confidential information had to be drafted on commonwealth laptop computers in approved locations and printed on a commonwealth-provided printer. They could not be copied and Collaery had to keep a secure register recording each time confidential material was handled, according to the submission. “The loss of the ordinary efficiencies that come from use of email, the internet, and telephone and video meetings was profound,” Collaery’s lawyers told the inquiry. “Repeated travel and in person meetings were required to obtain instructions and manage the case. His lawyers were prevented from using the internet in some court proceedings, forcing them to print all material. “If the need arose for an additional confidential document to be provided in court, an approved person had to return to a secure location, to connect to a secure printer from the secure laptop, print the document and transport it back to court.” Collaery’s lawyers said they understood the need for document-handling restrictions, but said they currently posed serious practical barriers to running a case. Meeting the costs of the requirements would also be “prohibitive” for most defendants. They recommended the establishment of a public legal funding scheme to cover the costs of defendants involved in NSI Act cases. That recommendation has also been made by the Law Council of Australia and the Human Rights Legal Centre (HRLC) in separate submissions to the inquiry. “It is extremely onerous to represent a client under the NSI Act,” the HRLC said. “Some of these requirements may be justifiable given the national security risk involved. But there is a significant risk that such burdens will lead to representatives declining to act in such matters, or the costs of such representation may increase to a position where clients cannot afford it.” The Law Council of Australia said such a scheme should be funded by the commonwealth and “should not be means- or merits-tested”.

          "bodyText": "Staff at Fujitsu, the technology firm at the centre of the Post Office Horizon scandal, are due to go on strike tomorrow, which their trade union said could disrupt HM Revenue and Customs at the busiest time of year for tax collection. About 300 staff, most of whom work in IT support for HMRC at sites in Telford and Stratford, east London, will go on strike in protest at a pay offer that the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said was 10 times less than what Fujitsu is offering staff in Japan. The PCS said Fujitsu staff involved in fixing and protecting HMRC computers would take further action between 18 January and 15 February. HMRC is understood to be confident that industrial action would not affect its ability to process self-assessment tax returns in the busy weeks before the 31 January deadline. However, the PCS said it believed the strike was “likely to disrupt those seeking to complete their self-assessment tax returns by the end of the month”. The union said the strike had nothing to do with the faulty Horizon IT system, which produced incorrect data that the Post Office used to wrongly accuse thousands of postmasters of theft and fraud. That scandal is expected to cost taxpayers at least £1bn in compensation and Fujitsu said on Tuesday it bore moral responsibility to contribute financially. The company has defended its continued role in government contracts, including for the Ministry of Defence and HMRC. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “Why is the UK government giving Fujitsu lucrative contracts when the company treats its UK workers so badly? “Why is it workers in Japan are deemed worthy of a pay rise almost 10 times more than those in the UK? “Fujitsu made £22m profit last year in the UK, so it can afford to pay our members a decent wage – it just chooses not to. Fujitsu said: “We remain committed to continue pay talks to try to resolve this situation and welcome further discussions at any time. “Fujitsu will be taking all necessary steps to ensure operational continuity for all our customers and are working closely with those customers throughout the planning process.” An HMRC spokesperson said: “We have robust plans in place to ensure we continue delivering critical services for our customers during any industrial action.”",
