    "contentPreview": "A vulnerable autistic man is pleading with the UK government to block his extradition to the US on cybercrime charges where he faces a 52-year sentence for alleged offending that began when he was a child. Diogo Santos Coelho, who has been assessed as at very high risk of suicide, said he had been groomed and exploited online by adults from the age of 14 into committing the alleged crimes, which relate to the website RaidForums. Coelho is accused of being the administrator of RaidForums, described in court as \u201ca marketplace for individuals to buy and sell stolen databases\u201d with about 10bn stolen records. Both the US and Portugal have issued extradition requests for the 24-year-old, leaving the decision on which one to pick in the hands of the security minister, Tom Tugendhat, although an appeal against the US request is waiting to be heard. Coelho said: \u201cI\u2019m just scared of the US system seeking retribution whereas I see the European systems, even the UK and Portugal, as more leaning to..."

    "contentPreview": "Frank Hester has got rich running one of the companies most critical to the UK\u2019s health infrastructure, but most people will never have heard of him or his firm. By Hester\u2019s own estimation, the Phoenix Partnership (TPP) \u2013 the software company he built from scratch and solely owns \u2013 is worth \u00a31bn after winning more than \u00a3400m of NHS and prison contracts in the last eight years. To celebrate reaching this milestone in 2019, he threw a \u201cunicorn party\u201d at his mansion near Leeds, complete with horses dressed up with horns, and his staff were invited to celebrate. A computer programmer from West Yorkshire\u2019s biggest city, Hester is included on the Sunday Times rich list with an estimated wealth of \u00a3415m. Former employees tell of big perks and a partying lifestyle for staff, driven by Hester. He would provide a free bar at the local pub on Fridays, and staff would be invited to week-long sailing trips, paid for by the company. A larger-than-life personality, Hester would often socialise with s..."

    "contentPreview": "My husband, James Watson, who has died aged 76, was a computer specialist in the civil service. His career spanned the progression from room-sized mainframe computers through to laptops and the internet. Early in his career he worked on the LEO (the first business computer) and extensively on ICL 1900s \u2013 such that he could later inform a specialist at the National Museum of Computing in Bletchley why their explanation of how one operated was not exactly correct. He looked back fondly on helping to bring in decimalisation in 1971. Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Jim was the son of George, a Scot, who served as a police officer, and his wife, Margaret (nee Jameson), a midwife. He went to Rutherford grammar school in Newcastle before joining the civil service after A-levels at the age of 18, beginning in 1965 at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, where he worked on pension arrangements with Ireland. In 1970 he was posted to the Ministry of Transport in Harmondsworth on the edge..."

    "contentPreview": "Ministers need to \u201cimmediately\u201d update the law to acknowledge that computers are fallible or risk a repeat of the Horizon scandal, legal experts say. In English and Welsh law, computers are assumed to be \u201creliable\u201d unless proven otherwise. But critics of this approach say this reverses the burden of proof normally applied in criminal cases. Stephen Mason, a barrister and expert on electronic evidence, said: \u201cIt says, for the person who\u2019s saying \u2018there\u2019s something wrong with this computer\u2019, that they have to prove it. Even if it\u2019s the person accusing them who has the information.\u201d Mason, along with eight other legal and computer experts, was invited by the government to suggest an update to the law in 2020, following a high court ruling against the Post Office, but the recommendations they submitted were never applied. He and colleagues had been expressing alarm about the presumption as far back as 2009. \u201cMy view is that the Post Office would never have got anywhere near as far as it di..."

    "contentPreview": "As a Fulton county, Georgia, board of registration and elections meeting began in earnest on Thursday afternoon, the elections director, Nadine Williams, unfurled a prepared statement about a recent hack of county government computers. \u201cThere is no indication that this event is related to the election process,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIn an abundance of caution, Fulton county and the secretary of state\u2019s respective technology systems were isolated from one another as part of the response efforts. We are working with our team to securely reconnect these systems as preparations for upcoming elections continue.\u201d Any time the Fulton county elections board meets, a cantankerous crowd greets them to pepper appointees with challenges to voter registrations or demands for paper ballots or generally unsympathetic noise. The rancor of the 2020 election and its unfounded charges of vote tampering still ripple through the democratic process. Elections officials in Fulton county take care about what they s..."

    "contentPreview": "The UK\u2019s beleaguered public libraries have been let down by years of indecision and delays over how to spend millions of pounds in funding earmarked for a nationwide website. This was among damning criticisms voiced on Saturday by campaigners who have lost patience with the government, the British Library and Arts Council England (ACE) over their longstanding failure to develop a nationwide scheme. The \u201cSingle Digital Presence\u201d (SDP) \u2013 renamed LibraryOn \u2013 was meant to bring together public libraries in one website to enable the public to access collections across the country. The problem has been that there are 150 library authorities in England alone, each with their own technology and management systems. Government funds have been allocated in various tranches to ACE and the British Library to make it happen. Tim Coates, a libraries campaigner and former head of bookseller Waterstones, told the Observer: \u201cWe\u2019re now 10 years later and \u2013 after several reviews and studies and about \u00a36m..."

Anthony Albanese confirmed the new investment on the opening day of his state visit to the United States during an event at the Australian embassy in Washington, flanked by Microsoft\u2019s vice-chair and president, Brad Smith, and Microsoft Australia and New Zealand Managing director Steven Worrall. The announcement in Washington comes ahead of the Albanese government articulating a new Australian cybersecurity strategy covering the period to 2030.

After starting his day in the US capital with a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider at Arlington National Cemetery and a visit to the gravesites of two Australians buried there, Albanese confirmed Microsoft\u2019s plans at..."

    "contentPreview": "The secrecy restrictions around Bernard Collaery\u2019s prosecution were so severe that he was forced to obtain government approval for his lawyer to view evidence against him, communicate with his legal team in-person in secure rooms chosen by the commonwealth, physically transport documents around the country at exorbitant cost and compose drafts on commonwealth laptop computers at pre-approved locations. The national security law watchdog is currently investigating the operation and effectiveness of the National Security Information Act 2004 (NSI Act), which the federal government uses to protect sensitive information during court proceedings. The use of the NSI Act has prompted concern in several cases in recent years, including in the Collaery case, where significant parts of his since-abandoned trial would have been hidden from the public. In an extraordinary submission to the inquiry, Collaery\u2019s legal team has detailed the \u201cprofound\u201d cost and disadvantage his legal team faced as a re..."

    "contentPreview": "Staff at Fujitsu, the technology firm at the centre of the Post Office Horizon scandal, are due to go on strike tomorrow, which their trade union said could disrupt HM Revenue and Customs at the busiest time of year for tax collection. About 300 staff, most of whom work in IT support for HMRC at sites in Telford and Stratford, east London, will go on strike in protest at a pay offer that the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said was 10 times less than what Fujitsu is offering staff in Japan. The PCS said Fujitsu staff involved in fixing and protecting HMRC computers would take further action between 18 January and 15 February. HMRC is understood to be confident that industrial action would not affect its ability to process self-assessment tax returns in the busy weeks before the 31 January deadline. However, the PCS said it believed the strike was \u201clikely to disrupt those seeking to complete their self-assessment tax returns by the end of the month\u201d. The union said the strike..."
